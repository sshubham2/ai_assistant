    1. **Improved Contextual Understanding**: 
       When starting a new question or topic, clearing chat history helps the model focus on the current context without being influenced by irrelevant previous conversations.
       
    2. **Enhanced Clarity**:
       By removing unrelated history, users can ensure that their inquiries are clear and straightforward, which can lead to more accurate responses.
       
    3. **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
       Users donâ€™t need to sift through past messages to formulate their new questions, making the interaction more efficient and user-friendly.
       
    4. **Better Performance**:
       Clearing chat history can prevent the model from generating responses that might be influenced by older, irrelevant context, leading to higher quality outputs.
       
    5. **Focused Interactions**:
       Each interaction can be treated as a standalone session, allowing users to explore new topics without the baggage of previous discussions.

st.subheader("Tips for Better LLM Prompting")
st.write("""
1. **Be Specific**:
    Clearly articulate what you're asking. Instead of vague queries, provide context and specifics to guide the model's response.

2. **Use Examples**:
    Providing examples of what you're looking for can help the model understand your expectations better.

3. **Ask Direct Questions**:
    Formulate your prompts as direct questions to elicit more focused and concise answers.

4. **Limit Complexity**:
    Avoid overly complex questions that may confuse the model. Break down complex inquiries into simpler parts.

5. **Iterate on Responses**:
    If the first response isnâ€™t satisfactory, refine and rephrase your prompt based on the output to improve clarity and relevance.

6. **Give Feedback**:
    If applicable, inform the model of what parts of its response were useful or not, which can help it generate better responses in the future.

7. **Stay On Topic**:
    For the best responses, keep your questions related to the current topic and avoid jumping between unrelated subjects.
